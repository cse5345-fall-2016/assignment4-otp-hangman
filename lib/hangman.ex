    # strategy so that whenever the dictionary crashes, all of the games
    # (children) crash as well, and with the permanent restart option they all
    # restart. The game server has the one for one strategy so that as per the
    # instructions, if the game crashes it will restart itself ONLY, and I used
    # the transient restart option so that it would only restart when it crashes
    # or errors out and not if it just exits.
